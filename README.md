# Car Sales Predictions Using Gradient Boosting Regression Models

In this project we built a few regression models using gradient boosting to predict prices of a given vehicle. This was done as a mock assignment for a company wanting to attract more customers by adding a feature that allowed customers to get a valuation on a vehicle within their app.

We used a dataset which can be found and dowloaded within this repo `car_sales.csv` for replication or your own personal use/experimentations.

This project was a great way to put into practice what I learned regarding gradient boosting. There is an explanation on the gradient boosting algorithm in the `gradient_boosting_algorithm.ipynb` file within this repo.

I hope you enjoy!
