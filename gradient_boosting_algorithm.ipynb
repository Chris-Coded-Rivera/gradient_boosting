    "    Once the task/objective for a task is identified (in this case we'll be predicting values of vehicles) a loss function must be chosen to evaluate a model's performance. In this project, we've chosen root mean squared error, or RMSE. The loss function is denoted as L(y,a), where <em>y</em> represents the true value and <em>a</a> represents the predicted value. The model's training task is to reduce loss after each iteration an thus the function representing such task is written belowe followed by RMSE loss function implementation:\n",

    "    Gradient function is an efficient way models perform loss function minimization. The function is used to help determine the direction the values should follow to reach the loss function minimum. In machine learning, the values represent the model weights.

The step size valiue indicates the magnitude the model will change in its $x$ value to find the loss function minimum. If the step size is too large, the model will miss the ideal weight to get the true loss function minimum. If too low, the model will take a long time to find the minimum.
